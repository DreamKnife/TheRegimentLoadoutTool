The Regiment Loadout Tool v1.0

The Regiment Loadout Tool is a tool that enables users to change the weapons of just about all of the characters in The Regiment.  It does this by modifying two of the games files, "SASGame.u" and "SASChars.u".  This tool also works with the "Terror Strike" version of the game.
